Over the last 50 years the production of goods has not slowed, on the contrary production levels have increased. From 1971 to 2020 CO2 green house gases have made serious impact on our planet, this data analysis different countries emission levels. Through out this lab we foucs on finding the top ten emitters in the world and graph them to understand their trends. Overall, I found that emission levels from the top ten countries are on the rise.
